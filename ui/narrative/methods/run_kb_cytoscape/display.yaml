description: <p>This tool provides an interface to the KBase Arabidopsis datasets
  supplied by the Jacobson lab at Oak Ridge National Lab. Users can perform a simple
  query to retrieve an initial dataset of interest, and then use the report produced
  to further examine their data. Data is provided as a set of nodes and edges, where
  nodes are gene or phenotype data, and the edges represent connections between them.
