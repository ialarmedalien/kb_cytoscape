name: Run yet another KBase method
parameters:
  cluster_ids:
    long-hint: Fetch all nodes that are members of the specified cluster(s), and the
      edges and nodes within the specified distance (number of hops) of those nodes.
    short-hint: Fetch nodes by cluster ID, in the form "clustering_system_name:cluster_id".
      Enter each ID on a new line.

  distance:
    short-hint: Number of hops to find neighbors and neighbors-of-neighbors
    ui-name: Traversal Distance
  edge_types:
    short-hint: Edge types to filter on
    ui-name: Edge Types
  search_text:
    long-hint: Search for nodes using a simple fuzzy search on node metadata; return
      the matching nodes, and the edges and nodes within the specified distance (number
      of hops) of those nodes.
    short-hint: Search nodes and their metadata for the search string
    ui-name: Search text
  zero_or_one:
